# Testing in React

## Demo app http://localhost:3000/

## Jest snapshot tests https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing

- generate a serializable value for your React tree
    👀 `snapshot-tests/Notification.test.js.snap`
- should be commited in source code and reviewed duing PR process

👎 very easy to create and update

👎 very easy to misuse
    - too many, too big
    - false negative failures
    - hard to PR
    - unclear intention
    - false impression of good coverage
    - located separately from tested code

🚀 Best practices
- limit usage to small static components
- limit snapshot size (use ESLint jest/no-large-snapshots)
- prefer inline snapshots
    👀 `snapshot-tests/LikeButton.test.js`
- consider using diff snapshots
    👀 `snapshot-tests/NotificationHeader.test.js`
- consider using beyond React components
