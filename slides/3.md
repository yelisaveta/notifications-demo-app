# Testing in React

## Unit and integration testing with React Testing Library https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro

ðŸ“– From documentation:
> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
> This library is a replacement for Enzyme. While you can follow these guidelines using Enzyme itself, enforcing this is harder because of all the extra utilities that Enzyme provide

ðŸ¤” Compared to Enzyme: 
- no shallow rendering
- always renders your components in the DOM (jsdom)
- no way to interact with component instances, props, state etc.
- queries the DOM how real user would

ðŸš€ Best practices
- avoid testing implementation details
- focus on how users use your application
- allow for refactoring without breaking tests
- increase confidence in your tests

ðŸ‘€ `rtl/NotificationHeader.test.js` (one component)
ðŸ‘€ `rtl/Notification.test.js` (integration between components)
ðŸ‘€ `rtl/App.test.js` (the whole app)
