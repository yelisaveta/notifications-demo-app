# Testing in React

## Unit testing with Enzyme https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/

Rich API with different types of rendering (shallow, mount, static).

ðŸ‘Ž Easy to misuse shallow rendering and:
    - couple tests to implementation
    - create brittle tests that fail on refactor
    - create tests that pass when functionality is broken
    - loose confidence in your tests
